### Overview

- **Tagline:** A historical research project and massive data visualization covering the entire history of Crypto and Web3.
- **Description:** "The Grand Timeline" is an ambitious project that aims to document the entire history of blockchain technology, from its inception to the present, through an expansive and detailed infographic. The project focuses on key figures, events, and technological advancements in the crypto space, including the rise of L2 solutions like Optimism.
- **Relevance to Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama:** While this project does not directly integrate with Substrate or Polkadot, it serves as an educational tool that could benefit developers and users within these ecosystems by providing a comprehensive understanding of the crypto landscape.
- **Why this project:** As a product designer with a deep passion for blockchain technology, I embarked on this project to create a resource that simplifies and visualizes the complex history of the crypto industry. I believe that this will help attract new users to Web3 and foster a better understanding of its potential.

### Project Details

- **Problems Addressed:** The main problem addressed is the lack of comprehensive and accessible historical data on the crypto industry. By visualizing this history, the project aims to make it easier for newcomers and existing members of the community to understand and appreciate the development of blockchain technology.
- **Expected Results:** A detailed and visually engaging timeline that covers key events, people, and innovations in crypto and Web3. This timeline will be freely accessible online and will eventually include an interactive version.
- **What the Project is Not:** This project does not involve developing smart contracts or other blockchain-based technologies. It is a research and educational tool, not a technical infrastructure project.

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Target Audience:** The target audience includes crypto enthusiasts, developers, educators, and anyone interested in the history of blockchain technology.
- **Needs Addressed:** This project meets the need for an accessible, engaging, and comprehensive historical record of the crypto industry. It also serves as a resource for education and onboarding new users into the Web3 space.
- **Similar Projects:** No one has ever done anything like this. There are no direct competitors that cover the history of crypto and Web3 in such a detailed and visual format. The alternatives‚Äîbooks, articles, and videos‚Äîlack the same level of visual engagement and accessibility.

------------------


I tried to match your formal project description template but it seems I didn't do very well, sorry for that. A more friendly story about the project, what's unique about it (almost everything), and why I'm doing it, I described in a long read on Twitter ‚Äî [https://x.com/stepahin/status/1817955760753594557]()

To be honest, I would continue working on the project without publishing it, but right now things are going very poorly for me, so I'm trying to seek community support. I'm not sure if according to your rules you would accept me even at Level 1, but if I can apply for level 2, please let me know.

Thank you! üñ§
